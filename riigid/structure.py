class Structure:
    """Structure containing all the atoms and defined fragments.

    In RIIGID a structure is a set of atoms separated into disjunctive subsets called fragments.
    The fragments are treated as rigid bodies, that is, the bonds between all atoms belonging to
    the same fragment are frozen.
    As already said, all these fragments together then form the structure.

    Via the Structure class, fragments can be defined, forces and torques on all fragments can be
    calculated and the fragments can be moved accordingly.

    Attributes
    ----------
    atoms: ase.atoms.Atoms
        All atoms forming the structure, i.e, sum of all fragments.atoms (incl. rest_fragment).
    fragments: list of riigid.Fragment
        All fragments that have been defined.
    rest_fragment: riigid.Fragment
        All atoms that haven't been assigned a specific fragment together form the rest_fragment.

    """

        Parameters
        ----------
        atoms: ase.atoms.Atoms
            To initialize a structure, an atoms object must be given, which can later be separated
            into fragments. It will also be possible to define a fragment by adding additional atoms later
            on (not yet implemented).

        Define a new fragment by telling RIIGID the indices of the atoms (indices relative to
        Structure.atoms) that shall form the new fragment.

        Note
        ----
        Each atom has to belong to exactly one fragment! All atoms that the user never manually
        assigned to a specific fragment form another fragment together, called the rest_fragment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices: list of int
            The indices of the atoms forming the new fragment
        allowed_translation: str
            How shall the fragment be allowed to translate?
            If the string contains an "x", translation in x-direction is allowed, etc.
            E.g., to allow only translation in x- and y-direction, set allowed_translation="xy"
            To completely forbid any translation, use an empty string.
        allowed_rotation: str
            Allows the user to set constraints on the rotation axis of a fragment.
            Generally, the rotation axis (for a rigid body) is given my the matrix-vector product
            of the fragment's inverse inertia matrix with the torque acting on (the center of) the
            fragment. The rotation angle is then determined by the norm of the resulting vector.
            Using allowed_rotation, the user can apply the same logic as above to define, which components
            of the rotation axis shall be dropped.
            Examples:
            '' forbids any rotation
            'z' allows only rotation of the fragment around the (space-fixed) z-axis
            'xyz' allows for unrestricted rotation of the fragment

        Raises
        ------
