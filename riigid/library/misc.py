def get_indices_of_atoms1_in_atoms2(atoms1, atoms2, cutoff=1e-4):
    """Find the indices of the (the atoms of) atoms1 inside the atoms2 object.

    In the typical use of this function, atoms1 are the atoms of a fragment, while
    atoms2 are the atoms of the full structure.

    To determine the indices, atoms are considered identical, if they are of the same species
    and the distance between them is less than cutoff.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms1: ase.atoms.Atoms
        The atoms, whose indices are searched
    atoms2: ase.atoms.Atoms
        The atoms, where atoms1 is searched in
    cutoff: number, default: 1e-4
        Atoms closer than cutoff, which are of the same species, are considered identical

    Returns
    -------
    list of int
        The list of indices; Normally this should be of the same length as atoms1
    bool
        Was the search successful?
        If not all atoms were found (the returned list is shorter than len(atoms1)), this
        is set to False (In this case, the returned list is useless, but still returned for
        compatibility reasons).
        If all atoms have been found once (the returned list is of length len(atoms1)), this is
        set to True.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If some atoms have been found more than once, an exception is raised. This indicates an
        ill-defined Atoms object.
