class GDWAS(Optimizer):
    """RIIGID optimizer: Gradient Descent with Adaptive Stepsize

    Calculates force and torque on each fragment and moves them accordingly (like rigid bodies).

    The goal of this optimizer is to converge to the nearest minimum. To achieve this, in case the
    last update of the atomic positions lead to higher energies, it is dropped and the calculation
    is continued from the previous structure. This way, climbing upwards in the potential energy
    surface (PES) is prohibited and the probability for jumping into a different potential well is
    lowered.
    Additionally, a hard cap on the movement of individual fragments is enforced by max_trans and max_rot. This again
    helps in reducing the probability of the structure leaving a local minimum.

    The stepsize is adaptive and can change for two reasons:

    1.) If the last update performed on the atomic positions lowered the total energy (i.e a larger
    negative number), the stepsize is increased by multiplying with stepsize_factor_up.
    On the other hand, if the energy increased, the stepsize is lowered by multiplying with
    stepsize_factor_dn.

    2.) As described above, a hard cap on the movement of individual fragments is enforced by max_trans and max_rot.
    If a fragment is found to translate more than max_trans, the stepsize is lowered in such a way,
    that the maximal displacement of the fragments is exactly max_trans.
    On the other hand, if a fragment is rotated by more than max_rot, the stepsize is adapted, such that
    the maximal rotation (i.e. the rotation of the fragment that rotates the most) is max_rot.

    The user never needs to interact directly with the stepsize. Instead, via max_trans_0 and max_rot_0, the user
    specifies how much the fragments (at most) shall move in the first optimization step. The stepsize
    is then initialized accordingly and from there on adapted automatically, as described above.
