class GDWAS(Optimizer):
    """RIIGID optimizer: Gradient Descent with Adaptive Stepsize

    Calculates force and torque on each fragment and moves them accordingly (like rigid bodies).

    The goal of this optimizer is to converge to the nearest minimum. To achieve this, in case the
    last update of the atomic positions lead to higher energies, it is dropped and the calculation
    is continued from the previous structure. This way, climbing upwards in the potential energy
    surface (PES) is prohibited and the probability for jumping into a different potential well is
    lowered.
    Additionally, a hard cap on the movement of individual atoms is enforced by max_step. This again
    helps in reducing the probability of the structure leaving a local minimum.

    The stepsize is adaptive and can change for two reasons:

    1.) If the last update performed on the atomic positions lowered the total energy (i.e a larger
    negative number), the stepsize is increased by multiplying with stepsize_factor_up.
    On the other hand, if the energy increased, the stepsize is lowered by multiplying with
    stepsize_factor_dn.

    2.) As described above, a hard cap on the movement of individual atoms is enforced by max_step.
    If an atom is found to move more than it is allowed to, the stepsize is lowered in such a way,
    that the maximal displacement of the atoms is exactly max_step.

    The user never needs to interact directly with the stepsize. Instead, via max_step_0, the user
    specifies how much the atoms (at most) shall move in the first optimization step. The stepsize
    is then initialized accordingly and from there on adapted automatically, as described above.
